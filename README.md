## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

### FIX ISSUES ###
FIX/TIP (4:15) - echo $PATH does not work under windows (prompt). Instead, you must try just "path" (remove the quotations) on cmd/prompt.

FIX (9:38) - ERROR "Could not open input file: artisan" when run "php artisan serve": As he said, we must run this command inside the project folder. 

FIX (11:45) - make:auth works only on Laravel 5.8 and older versions.* The newer version, try: 
1. composer require laravel/ui
2. php artisan ui vue --auth
3. npm install && npm run dev

FIX (22:00) - If you try to use "vim" over Windows cmd: for Windows users, "vim" should not works. So, being at the project folder, try: copy con database\database.sqlite (press enter, so F6 then, enter again). It will create the file with nothing inside. METHOD 2: re-create this file using a different method, like (under windows os) right-click on the project folder, "create new text file" (but rename the extension txt to sqlite!) and rename it to database.sqlite

FIX (23:35) - console echoes for php artisan migrate: "Could not find driver (SQL: PRAGMA...": Just open php.ini and uncomment extension=pdo_sqlite (or extension=pdo_mysql if you use it).
If this error persists, even after uncommenting  extension=pdo_sqlite, with PHP Warning "PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'pdo_sqlite'". Try fix that by typing: 
sudo apt-get install php7.4-sqlite
